# Using Sessions

This guide explains how to create sessions, capture telemetry, and analyze laps with AI coaching.

## Creating a Session

1. From the home page, click **"New Session"**.
2. Enter a session name (for example, `Monza Practice - June 15`).
3. Select a telemetry source:
   - **Live** – Connect to a running Assetto Corsa or ACC instance.
   - **Demo** – Use pre-recorded telemetry data shipped with the project.

Once created, the session will appear in your session list/archives.

## During a Session

While a session is running, you can:

- **View Live Telemetry** – Real-time throttle, brake, steering, speed, etc.
- **Pause/Resume** – Pause analysis during cool-down laps or breaks.
- **Automatic Lap Detection** – Each lap is automatically saved when you cross the start/finish line.

Sessions and laps are stored so you can revisit them later.

## Analyzing Laps with AI

1. From the session archive, click on a completed lap.
2. Click **"Analyze Lap"** to request AI-powered feedback.
3. Review suggestions such as:
   - "Brake later entering Turn 2."
   - "Apply throttle more progressively out of Turn 5."
4. Use the chat to ask targeted questions, for example:
   - "Would trail-braking help in Turn 3?"
   - "Am I losing more time on corner entry or exit?"

The AI model is optimized for racing telemetry and driving technique, helping you turn raw data into actionable improvements.
